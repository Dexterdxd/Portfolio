          <h3>Web Development</h3>
         
          <p>
            I am deeply engaged in expanding my skills and knowledge of current technologies to enhance my 
             capabilities. I am actively pursuing opportunities to learn 
             new programming languages, frameworks, and tools that are

              My set of skills consist of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. I also have some experience with React.
              My goal is to continuously 
              grow and evolve as a developer, ultimately contributing effectively
               to impactful projects and achieving professional excellence.

          <h3>UI/UX Designer</h3>
     
          <p>
            I have been involved in multiple university projects where my team 
            and I prioritize design using tools like Figma to ensure our projects 
            are visually appealing and user-friendly before development begins. This 
            experience has enhanced my creativity in designing projects, making them 
            aesthetically pleasing and intuitive for users."
            <span class="more-text hidden" data-readmore-id="3">
              <br /><br />
              I know how to design and organize site designs using Figma. I also have 
              experience with a number of other programs, including Sketch, Adobe XD, 
              Adobe Illustrator, and more. With the help of these tools, I can efficiently
               develop and improve ideas to make sure they satisfy both functional and aesthetic needs.

          <p>
            Effective communication is essential to our project development
             process because it allows us to interact with clients and make 
             compelling presentations of our ideas. I sometimes take the lead 
             on our team when it comes to demonstrating how to use or connect with 
             our systems, which has really helped me improve my communication skills.
            <span class="more-text hidden" data-readmore-id="4">
              <br /><br />
              I am deeply passionate about continuously enhancing my communication skills.
               I believe effective communication is crucial not only for conveying ideas 
               clearly to clients and team members but also for fostering strong relationships
                and achieving project goals. I actively seek opportunities to refine my ability 
                to articulate complex concepts and instructions in a clear and engaging manner. 
                Through experiences such as guiding clients in using our systems effectively,
                 I have developed a genuine enthusiasm for improving how I communicate, ensuring 
                 I can contribute effectively to our team's success.
